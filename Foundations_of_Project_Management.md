## 📌 What Is Project Management?

At its core, **Project Management** is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. It is a discipline that organizes and manages resources so a project is completed within defined scope, quality, time, and cost constraints.

A project is **temporary** (has a defined beginning and end) and **unique** (it differs from routine operations).

### The "Iron Triangle" of Constraints

```
     Scope
      / \
     /   \
Time ----- Cost
```

- **Scope**: What is to be delivered
- **Time**: When it must be delivered
- **Cost**: The resources required to deliver it

Balancing these constraints is at the heart of project management.

## 👩‍💼 The Role of a Project Manager

A **Project Manager (PM)** is responsible for leading a project from initiation to closure. The PM ensures the team delivers on goals, on time, and within budget, while keeping stakeholders informed.

### Key Responsibilities
- Defining project goals and objectives
- Creating a detailed project plan
- Managing resources (time, people, budget)
- Identifying and mitigating risks
- Communicating with stakeholders

## 🔄 The Project Lifecycle

Every project follows a structured set of phases, collectively called the **Project Lifecycle**:

```
Initiation → Planning → Execution → Monitoring & Controlling → Closure
```

### 1. Initiation
- Define the project at a broad level
- Create a project charter 
- Identify stakeholders

### 2. Planning
- Establish scope, schedule, cost, and quality plans
- Develop WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
- Plan communication and risk response

### 3. Execution
- Allocate resources and manage teams
- Perform tasks as per the project plan
- Ensure quality assurance

### 4. Monitoring & Controlling
- Track performance via KPIs
- Update stakeholders regularly
- Adjust scope or resources as needed

### 5. Closure
- Finalize deliverables
- Release project resources
- Conduct post-mortem and archive documentation

## 🧱 Key Project Artifacts

### 📋 Project Charter
Outlines the project vision, objectives, scope, and key stakeholders.

### 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Breaks down the total scope of work into manageable tasks.

```
Project
├── Phase 1: Planning
│   ├── Task 1.1: Define scope
│   └── Task 1.2: Identify stakeholders
└── Phase 2: Execution
    ├── Task 2.1: Develop product
    └── Task 2.2: QA testing
```

### 🗂️ Risk Register
Tracks potential risks, their impact, probability, and mitigation plans.

### 🧾 Status Reports
Regular updates for stakeholders, covering progress, issues, and forecasts.

## 🧰 Core Methodologies at a Glance

### Waterfall
- Linear and sequential
- Good for projects with fixed scope

### Agile
- Iterative and incremental
- Ideal for evolving requirements

### Scrum
- Time-boxed sprints, roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master
- Daily standups and reviews

### Kanban
- Visual board with columns for task status
- Great for continuous delivery

---

## 📊 Estimation and Scheduling Techniques

### PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique)
```
Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
```

### Gantt Chart
Visual timeline for tasks and dependencies.

### Critical Path Method (CPM)
Identifies the longest path of planned tasks to the end of the project.

---

## 🚦 Monitoring and KPIs

### Key Metrics
- Schedule Variance (SV)
- Cost Performance Index (CPI)
- Earned Value (EV)
- Burn-down Charts (Agile)

### Tools
- Excel, Google Sheets
- Jira, Trello, MS Project

---

## 🔍 Quality, Risk, and Change Management

### Quality Management
- Plan → Control → Improve
- Align with stakeholder expectations

### Risk Management
- Identify → Analyze → Plan → Monitor
- Track via Risk Register

### Change Control
- Assess impact before approving
- Formal change log and approval process
